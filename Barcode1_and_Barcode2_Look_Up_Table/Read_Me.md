**Goal of this Folder**

The goal of this code is to process double barcoded sequencing data and create a look up table similar to Barcode1 look up table, except this time instead of BC1 + Tile the LUT will be BC1 + BC2. The same methods are used to indentify quality reads that contain the BCs between specific flanking sequences and checking that the BC are the correct length. There is not design file needed in any of these code because there are no Tile here.
