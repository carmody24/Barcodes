The sepearte version of BC1 LUT has many seperate scripts and BASH files that I used when first creating these to make it easier for debugging steps.

In the future I will add an additional Combined folder that will consolidate the steps into fewer scripts for steps that do not require analysis/interperataion of the results before moving onto the next step.
