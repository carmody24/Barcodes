these are my files to process Treble Seq libraries that have my origional barcode names not BC1,BC2,BC3. eventually I hope to convert them to more plug and play BC names.

HawkBC are hawkings barcodes associated with the activation domain tile, ADBC2 is a secondary AD barcode added via PCR, HA is the combination of hawkings and ADBC2, RTBC is the reporter barcode
